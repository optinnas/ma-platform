# Contributing to Lunogram

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lunogram! We're excited to have you join our community.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally
2. **Set up your development environment** following the instructions below
3. **Create a branch** for your changes

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) (1.25+)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (24+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose
- [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) (0.40+, for building WASM modules)

## Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker (Quickest)

Run everything in Docker, including the Go backend:

```bash
# Clone your fork and cd into it
cd platform

# Start all services (with rebuild)
docker compose up -d --build
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:8080.

### Option 2: Local Development (Recommended for Development)

Run the Go backend and console locally for faster iteration:

#### 1. Start Dependencies

First, start the required services (PostgreSQL, Redis, NATS):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.deps.yml up -d
```

#### 2. Run the Console (Frontend)

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd console
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The console will be available at http://localhost:5173.

#### 3. Run the Go Backend

In another terminal:

```bash
# Install dependencies and build
make generate

# Run the server
go run ./cmd/lunogram
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8080.
